# **Binary Search**

**Binary search** is one of the most fundamental and efficient algorithms for searching a sorted dataset. By continually halving the search range, we can locate elements in O(log N) time, a significant improvement over a linear scan, which operates in O(N) time.

This post covers the essentials of binary search—its core logic, time and space complexity, common pitfalls, and potential extensions for more advanced usage.

## **What Is Binary Search?**

Binary search takes advantage of **sorted data** to cut down the search interval by half on each comparison. Here’s the high-level process:

1. Identify the middle index of the current search range (initially, the entire array).
2. Compare the value at the middle index with your target value.
3. Depending on the comparison:
   - If the middle value is equal to the target, you’re done.
   - If the middle value is less than the target, focus on the _right half_.
   - If the middle value is greater than the target, focus on the _left half_.
4. Repeat until you find the target or until the range is empty.

Because you eliminate half of the search space after each comparison, the time complexity is **O(log N).**

## **Time Complexity**

- **Time Complexity:** O(log N)

  Each comparison rules out half of the current search interval, so we need roughly comparisons to find (or fail to find) the target in a sorted array of size .

- **Space Complexity:**
  - **Iterative approach (using a while loop):** O(1) additional space.
  - **Recursive approach:** O(logN) in the worst case, due to recursion stack.

## **Pitfalls & Key Considerations**

1. **Data Must Be Sorted**

   Binary search only works correctly on data that is sorted in ascending (or descending) order. If your data is not sorted, you must sort it first, or use a suitable data structure (e.g., a balanced tree or a sorted list).

2. **Overflow in Middle Calculation**

   A naive approach often does mid = (left + right) / 2;.

   When left and right are large, **left + right could overflow in some languages** (though less common in Java with 64-bit indices, it’s still a best practice to avoid it). To be safe, GPT suggests to use:

```
mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
```

This ensures that (right - left) never exceeds the range of your integer.

3. **Handling Duplicate Values**

   When your sorted data contains duplicates, you might need to locate not just _any_ occurrence of the target but the _first_ or _last_ occurrence. **To do that, you can adapt the binary search to continue searching** either the left or right half even after finding a match until you confirm it’s the earliest or latest index that contains the target.

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty arrays or lists.
   - Arrays containing a single element.
   - Targets smaller than the smallest element or larger than the largest element.
   - Off-by-one errors in index handling.

## **Example: Iterative Implementation (Java)**

Below is a straightforward iterative example of binary search. This code returns the **index** of the target if found; otherwise, it returns -1.

```java
public class BinarySearchExample {

    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            // Avoid potential overflow
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                return mid;  // Found the target
            } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;  // Search right half
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; // Search left half
            }
        }

        return -1; // Target not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] sortedArray = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13};
        int target = 7;
        int index = binarySearch(sortedArray, target);

        if (index >= 0) {
            System.out.println("Value " + target + " found at index " + index);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Value " + target + " not found");
        }
    }
}
```

## **Advanced Usage: Condition-Based Binary Search**

Binary search can be extended to scenarios beyond merely finding a single value:

- **Finding the boundary of a condition:** Sometimes, we need to locate the point at which a condition **changes** from false to true (or vice versa).
  For example, finding:
  - The first index where an element is greater than or equal to a given threshold.
  - The last index where the element is less than a certain threshold.
- **Searching for a maximum or minimum feasible value:**

  In certain optimization problems, especially those involving constraints (e.g., distributing resources, scheduling, placing markers, etc.), we can use binary search to guess a solution and check if it’s feasible. Then we adjust our search space (the “guessed” solution) accordingly.

For instance, consider [Programmers Problem #43236](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/43236), which involves placing stepping stones such that certain criteria are met. A typical solution approach is to **use binary search over possible distances between stones**. In each iteration, you check whether the configuration can meet the constraints with the chosen distance, and then adjust your search range if needed.
