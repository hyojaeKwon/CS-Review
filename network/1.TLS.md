# TLS (Transport Layer Security)

## 1. Overview

- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is a **security protocol** designed to ensure that personal information and data are transmitted securely over the internet. It is most commonly used to protect communication between web applications and servers in the form of HTTPS (HTTP + TLS), enabling **encryption**, **authentication**, and **integrity** for sensitive data.

---

## 2. Why Do We Need TLS?

- **Preventing Data Leaks and Attacks**  
  TLS encrypts data transferred over the network, providing safeguards against eavesdropping, tampering, and forgery attacks.

- **Implementing HTTPS**  
  By combining HTTP with TLS, you get **HTTPS**, allowing **secure** communication with a trusted server.

- **Increasing Trust**  
  Because TLS uses certificates to verify server legitimacy, it helps protect users from phishing and spoofing websites.

## 3. Key Features Provided by TLS

1. **Encryption**  
   Ensures that any data transmitted across the network is unreadable to unauthorized parties.

2. **Authentication**  
   Verifies whether the **server (or client)** involved in the communication is actually trustworthy.

3. **Integrity**  
   Guarantees that the data has not been **tampered with** or **forged** during transmission.

## 4. What Is a TLS (SSL) Certificate?

- **Certificate Issuance**  
  A public **Certificate Authority (CA)** issues certificates after **verifying** the domain owner (or organization).

- **Included Information**  
  A certificate contains the server’s (domain’s) **public key** and ownership details. Browsers and other TLS-enabled clients use this information to confirm that the server truly owns the domain and is trustworthy.

- **Role**  
  When a web server sets up an **HTTPS connection**, it uses the certificate to reveal its **identity** and **public key**, thereby initiating secure encrypted communication.

## 5. How Does TLS Work?

A TLS connection is established through a process known as the **TLS Handshake**.

Whenever you access a website via HTTPS or make an API call over HTTPS, the **client and server** exchange necessary information to set up a secure connection.

### 5.1. TLS 1.2 Handshake Steps

1. **ClientHello**

   - **Client → Server**: Sends supported TLS versions, a list of encryption algorithms (Cipher Suites), random bytes (Client Random), etc.

2. **ServerHello**

   - **Server → Client**: Responds with the chosen Cipher Suite, random bytes (Server Random), etc.
   - Sends the **SSL/TLS certificate** so the client can verify it.

3. **Authentication**

   - The client verifies the server’s certificate with the **CA**, ensuring the server is indeed the legitimate domain owner.
   - Once the certificate is verified, everything is set for secure communication.

4. **Pre-Master Secret Transmission**

   - The client generates a random string called the Pre-Master Secret and encrypts it with the **server’s public key**, then sends it to the server.

5. **Server Uses Its Private Key**

   - The server decrypts the Pre-Master Secret with its **private key**.
   - Both client and server now share the same Pre-Master Secret.

6. **Creating the Session Key**

   - Both sides combine the Client Random, Server Random, and Pre-Master Secret to derive the **session key**.

7. **Client Handshake Finished**

   - The client sends a **Finished** message encrypted with the session key to the server, indicating successful completion of the handshake process.

8. **Server Handshake Finished**

   - The server sends a **Finished** message (also encrypted with the session key) back to the client.

9. **Symmetric Encryption**
   - Now, both the client and server can use the shared session key to **encrypt** and **decrypt** all subsequent communication.

### 5.2. TLS 1.2 Handshake Round-Trip Times (RTT)

- Traditionally requires about **3 RTTs** (Round-Trip Times).
  - **1st RTT**: ClientHello → ServerHello
  - **2nd RTT**: Key exchange (e.g., Pre-Master Secret)
  - **3rd RTT**: Finished message exchange

---

### 5.3. TLS 1.3: Faster and Simpler Handshake

**TLS 1.3** simplifies the handshake process to reduce RTT.

#### 1-RTT Handshake

- The **ClientHello** can include the Pre-Master Secret, condensing what used to be multiple steps into **1 RTT**.
- The server can immediately process and verify the information necessary to generate the session key, making the handshake faster.

#### 0-RTT Handshake

- If the server has previously communicated with the client, **session resumption** allows **0-RTT** connections.
- The **client** can reuse stored session information (Session Ticket), and the server can quickly confirm and begin encrypted communication.
- However, **replay attacks** can be a concern in 0-RTT, so for certain critical transactions (like payments), the server may implement special defense mechanisms.

---

## 6. Summary

- **TLS** is a **security protocol** that provides encryption, authentication, and integrity.
- **HTTPS** consists of **HTTP + TLS**, enabling secure web communication.
- **TLS 1.2** typically requires a 3-RTT handshake, while **TLS 1.3** can reduce the process to 1-RTT or even 0-RTT for session resumption.
